# Project Title

## Project Overview
This is a **console-based Java application** designed to manage entities and their interactions efficiently.  
The project demonstrates robust **object-oriented programming principles**, adherence to **SOLID design principles**, and the use of **software design patterns** for maintainability, scalability, and performance.  
It is suitable for long-running console applications that require **input validation, exception handling, logging, and optimized performance**.

## Use Cases

1. **Entity Creation**  
   Allows creation of core entities (tasks, classrooms, students, or assignments) using the **Factory Pattern** for consistent object initialization.

2. **Entity Management**  
   Enables adding, removing, and viewing entities, ensuring proper validations and preventing duplicates or conflicts.

3. **Conflict Detection / Notification**  
   Uses the **Observer Pattern** to notify users of conflicts, updates, or submissions related to entities.

4. **Centralized Management**  
   Implements **Singleton Pattern** for managing all entities centrally, ensuring only one manager instance exists.

5. **Data Validation & Error Handling**  
   Provides robust input validation, exception handling, and informative error messages for invalid operations.

6. **Reporting / Viewing**  
   Displays entities in a structured and sorted manner for easy monitoring and management.

## Design Patterns Implemented
- **Singleton** – Ensures centralized management of entities  
- **Factory** – Simplifies and standardizes entity creation  
- **Observer** – Alerts users of conflicts, updates, or submissions  

## Key Features
- CRUD operations for core entities  
- Conflict detection and notifications  
- Input validation and exception handling  
- Console-based, lightweight, and highly maintainable  
- Modular and extensible code structure
